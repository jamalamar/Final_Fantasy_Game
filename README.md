# Project One: Impossible Game
by Jamal Amar


## How it Works
-The game will be shown in a browser.
-Player's character is a geometric figure.
-Obstacles are "Spikes" or trangles.
-Obstacles will appear and the player needs to jump over them.
-The score counts how far you get in the obstacle course. 
-The Game increases dificulty gradually.
-If the player touches an obstacle: "Game Over".


## If Possible
-Be able to choose your character (geometric figure).
-Have a Reset button.
-Have highscore count.
-Add sound FX, or soundtrack.
-Transform character each time the game gets harder, or changes level(depending how game is done).
-Choose dificulty from the beginning.
