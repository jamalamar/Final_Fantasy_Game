# Project One: Final Fantasy
by Jamal Amar


## How it Works
	-The game will be shown in a browser.
	-Player and Enemy's characters have their own set of stats and attacks.
	-Non-stop battle.
	-Instead of a turn based fight, abilities will recharge over time to make fight more dynamic.
	-If a character's HP hits 0, Game Over. 


## If Possible
	-Have the user create its own fight(each with its own stats and recharge times):
		-Pick your class.
		-Pick your weapon.
		-Choose your enemy in order to change dificulty.
		
	-Adventure Mode:
		-Need to fight a set of different enemies to get to final boss.
		-Each fight more difficult than last one.
		-If dungeon is completed you win game.
		
	-Loot system to upgrade your stats whenever you kill a boss.
